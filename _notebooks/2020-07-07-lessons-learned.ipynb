        "1. Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "> _Not always. For example, sometimes you just have to predict the future, so you better use the \"end\" of your data to test your results._\n",

        "2. What is overfitting? Provide an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "> _Describes a scenario where the model was trained to long and it starts including the irrelevant parts of the dataset. So the model fits too closely to the training set._\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a metric? How does it differ from “loss”?\n",
        "\n",
        "> _With the metric one tries to measure the performance of a model. This has nothimng to do wit the optimization process while the loss function is used to optimize a model._\n",

        "\n",
        "> _The initial layers of a neural network are used for a bunch of networks. That is because they detct basic lines and that is needed for every kind of classification. Only the later layers are used identify specific classes. This reduces trianing time._\n",
